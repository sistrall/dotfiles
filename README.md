# dotfiles template

This is a dotfiles repository template: fork it and evolve as you prefer.

The usage is based on make: a basic Makefile takes care of checking dependencies and creating soft-link.

After you forked this, clone the repo in the .dotfiles forlder in your user folder, install it and start hacking:

    git clone https://github.com/sistrall/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles 
    make setup
